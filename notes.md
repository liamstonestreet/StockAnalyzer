# Notes For Learning

Covered Calls Info
- Ideal scenario: market price falls below strike price; no one buys your 100 shares. You keep your shares and the premium.
- Middle scenario: market price remains above strike price; your 100 shares are bought. You get the payment for the 100 shares (at strike price) and the premium.
- Worst scenario: 

- "Delta" in the context of Covered Calls, is the expected change in the premium (aka Option Price) for every $1 change in the stock's market price (price per share)
	- Lower is more conservative. This means the premium barely changes as market price fluctuates.
